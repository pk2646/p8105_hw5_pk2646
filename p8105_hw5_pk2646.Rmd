## Problem 1 

Read in the data 

```{r}
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
    mutate(
        city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
        resolved = case_when(
        disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
        disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
        disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
      )
    ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

The raw data contains information on each city within states and their corresponding status on homicide cases under the variable disposition. I have manipulated the data to only show the city and state name and the homicide case status. 

Learning more about the data and manipulate the data to summarize within cities to obtain the total number of homicides and the number of unsolved homicides (those for which the disposition is “Closed without arrest” or “Open/No arrest”).

```{r}
aggregate_df =
homicide_df %>% 
group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

Do a prop test for a single city. For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the prop.test function to estimate the proportion of homicides that are unsolved; save the output of prop.test as an R object, apply the broom::tidy to this object and pull the estimated proportion and confidence intervals from the resulting tidy dataframe.

```{r}
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved), 
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

Try to iterate for all the 50 states and cities. Now run prop.test for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract both the proportion of unsolved homicides and the confidence interval for each. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of purrr::map, purrr::map2, list columns and unnest as necessary to create a tidy dataframe with estimated proportions and CIs for each city.

```{r}
results_df = 
aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```


Create a plot that shows the estimates and CIs for each city – check out geom_errorbar for a way to add error bars based on the upper and lower limits. Organize cities according to the proportion of unsolved homicides.


```{r}
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))

```

## Problem 2 

### Part 1 

Reading just one file - 
```{r}
data_1 = 
  read_csv("lda_data/con_01.csv")
```

Reading all the files and creating a dataframe 

```{r}
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("lda_data"),
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("lda_data/", path),
    data = map(.x = path, ~read_csv(.x))
  ) %>% 
  unnest(data) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_replace(path, "lda_data/", ""),
    path = str_replace(path, ".csv", "")
    ) %>% 
  separate(path, into = c("study_arm", "subject_id"), sep = "_") %>% 
  mutate(
    subject_id = as.numeric(subject_id)
  )

  path_df =
    pivot_longer(
    path_df,
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week", 
    values_to = "data")
```

### Part 2 

```{r graph}
plot1 = (
  path_df %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = week, y = data, group = subject_id, color = study_arm)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = .5) +
    geom_path() +
    labs(
    title = "Time trends of the longitudinal study data",
    x = "Time in weeks",
    y = "data points"
  ))
```

## Problem 3 

### Part 1 

For each dataset, save μ̂  and the p-value arising from a test of H:μ=0 using α=0.05. 

```{r}
sim_mean = function(n=30, mu = 0, sigma = 5) {
  
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n = n, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
  )
  
  sim_data %>%
  t.test() %>%
  broom::tidy()
}

sim_results = 
  tibble(sample_size = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)) %>% 
  mutate(
    output_lists = map(.x = sample_size, ~rerun(5000, sim_mean(mu = .x))),
    estimate_dfs = map(output_lists, bind_rows)) %>% 
  select(-output_lists) %>% 
  unnest(estimate_dfs) %>% 
  select(sample_size, estimate, p.value)
```
