Homework 5
================

## Problem 1

Read in the data

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
    mutate(
        city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
        resolved = case_when(
        disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
        disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
        disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
      )
    ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

The raw data contains information on each city within states and their
corresponding status on homicide cases under the variable disposition. I
have manipulated the data to only show the city and state name and the
homicide case status.

Learning more about the data and manipulate the data to summarize within
cities to obtain the total number of homicides and the number of
unsolved homicides (those for which the disposition is “Closed without
arrest” or “Open/No arrest”).

``` r
aggregate_df =
homicide_df %>% 
group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Do a prop test for a single city. For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the
prop.test function to estimate the proportion of homicides that are
unsolved; save the output of prop.test as an R object, apply the
broom::tidy to this object and pull the estimated proportion and
confidence intervals from the resulting tidy dataframe.

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved), 
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Try to iterate for all the 50 states and cities. Now run prop.test for
each of the cities in your dataset, and extract both the proportion of
unsolved homicides and the confidence interval for each. Do this within
a “tidy” pipeline, making use of purrr::map, purrr::map2, list columns
and unnest as necessary to create a tidy dataframe with estimated
proportions and CIs for each city.

``` r
results_df = 
aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

Create a plot that shows the estimates and CIs for each city – check out
geom\_errorbar for a way to add error bars based on the upper and lower
limits. Organize cities according to the proportion of unsolved
homicides.

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

### Part 1

Reading just one file -

``` r
data_1 = 
  read_csv("lda_data/con_01.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   week_1 = col_double(),
    ##   week_2 = col_double(),
    ##   week_3 = col_double(),
    ##   week_4 = col_double(),
    ##   week_5 = col_double(),
    ##   week_6 = col_double(),
    ##   week_7 = col_double(),
    ##   week_8 = col_double()
    ## )

Reading all the files and creating a dataframe

``` r
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("lda_data"),
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("lda_data/", path),
    data = map(.x = path, ~read_csv(.x))
  ) %>% 
  unnest(data) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_replace(path, "lda_data/", ""),
    path = str_replace(path, ".csv", "")
    ) %>% 
  separate(path, into = c("study_arm", "subject_id"), sep = "_") %>% 
  mutate(
    subject_id = as.numeric(subject_id)
  )
```

    ggplot(aes(x = week, y = data, group = subject_id, color = study_arm)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = .5) +

## Problem 3

### Part 1

For each dataset, save μ̂ and the p-value arising from a test of H:μ=0
using α=0.05.

``` r
sim_mean = function(n=30, mu = 0, sigma = 5) {
  
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n = n, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
  )
  
  sim_data %>%
  t.test() %>%
  broom::tidy()
}

sim_results = 
  tibble(sample_size = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)) %>% 
  mutate(
    output_lists = map(.x = sample_size, ~rerun(5000, sim_mean(mu = .x))),
    estimate_dfs = map(output_lists, bind_rows)) %>% 
  select(-output_lists) %>% 
  unnest(estimate_dfs) %>% 
  select(sample_size, estimate, p.value)
```
